# ASSUMPTIONS

This document mirrors `configs/assumptions.yml` for stakeholder-readable context.

## TEMP discipline
- TEMP assumptions must be explicitly declared in `configs/assumptions.yml`.
- TEMP assumptions used in a run are exported to `outputs/<scenario>/<timestamp>/assumptions_used.yml`.
- TEMP assumptions should include an explicit replacement plan and owner confirmation path.

## Current state
- No assumptions are currently marked `TEMP` in `configs/assumptions.yml`.
