description: 'Combined circularity policy package: collection + higher recovery/yield
  + reuse/reman (and optional demand reduction).'
requires_user_inputs:
- Targets and timing for collection_rate, recovery_rate, recycling_yield, reuse/reman
  share.
- Whether to include demand reduction and/or lifetime extension in the package.

notes:
- This package is intended for scenario comparison; keep each lever realistic to avoid
  infeasible combined effects.
- If adding lifetime extension, use r_lifetime_extension.yml pattern.
- 'v4.7: reuse/reman represented via lifetime extension (lifetime_multiplier_ge_1).'
