description: Extend product lifetimes (slower turnover) via a multiplier applied to
  lifetime parameters.
requires_user_inputs:
- Which lifetime parameterization is authoritative (mu/sigma or mean/min/max).
- Lifetime extension factor (e.g., 1.10 for +10%) and targeted end-uses.
levers:
  lifetime_multiplier_ge_1:
    shape: step
    year: 2030
    value: null
    targets:
      regions:
      - EU27
      materials:
      - Zn
      - Ni
      - Sn
      end_uses:
      - construction
      - machinery_and_equipment
      - motor_vehicles_trailers_and_semi_trailers
notes:
- Implementation should modify lognormal mu consistently (mean scales ~exp(mu)).
- Requires explicit code support; otherwise treat as documented scenario intention.
