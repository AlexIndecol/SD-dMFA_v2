  statement: 'Missing policy accepted: hold_first before first year, hold_last after
    last year, interpolate_linear inside gaps.'
  replacement_plan: If needed, add per-variable overrides in configs/data_sources.yml.
- id: exogenous_stock_and_gas_provided
  status: confirmed
  source: user
  scope: dmfa.initialization
  impact: high
  introduced_in_version: v4
  statement: Observed in-use stock and GAS are provided as exogenous time series for
    historic calibration.

  source: user
  scope: trade
  impact: high
  introduced_in_version: v4
  statement: OD trade matrices will be provided exogenously.
  replacement_plan: N/A
- id: trade_factor_baseline_1
  status: confirmed
  source: user
  scope: trade
  impact: medium
  introduced_in_version: v4
  statement: Trade friction factor defaults to 1.0 everywhere unless explicitly overridden.
  replacement_plan: Add shock/friction series if resilience conclusions require it.
- id: lifetimes_lognormal_miso2_aligned
  status: confirmed
  source: user
  scope: dmfa.lifetimes
  impact: high
  introduced_in_version: v4
  statement: Lifetime distributions follow MISO2-style lognormal (no Weibull).

- id: od_matrix_semantics_weights_vs_shares
  status: confirmed
  source: user_required
  scope: trade
  impact: high
  introduced_in_version: v4.4
  statement: OD matrices are interpreted as weights (relative preferences), not shares.
    OD allocator normalizes weights per origin and applies capacity/export ceilings.
  replacement_plan: User confirmation required before full runs.

  status: confirmed
  source: user_required
  scope: end_use_hierarchy
  impact: medium
  introduced_in_version: v4.4
  statement: jd tracking may be enabled when end_use_detail_share_frac is provided;
    reporting may aggregate to j or show jd breakdowns. User indicated either is acceptable.
  replacement_plan: User confirmation required before jd-level reporting.
