description: Divert a share of end-of-life products into reuse/reman loops.
requires_user_inputs:
- Which end-uses are eligible (machinery, vehicles, electronics).
- Diversion share trajectory and whether it reduces demand or shifts timing.

    shape: ramp
    start_year: 2025

      - EU27

      - motor_vehicles_trailers_and_semi_trailers
      - computers_and_precision_instruments
      - electrical_equipment
notes:
- Clarify whether reuse/reman reduces gross demand or delays EoL (lifetime effect).
- 'v4.7: If reuse/reman is represented via lifetime extension, prefer r_lifetime_extension.yml.
  This scenario represents an alternative (EoL diversion) and may be unused.'
