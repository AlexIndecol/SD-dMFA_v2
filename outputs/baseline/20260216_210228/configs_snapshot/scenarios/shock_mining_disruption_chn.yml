description: Temporary disruption of primary extraction capacity in CHN.
requires_user_inputs:
- Which materials are affected and severity (multiplier).
- Whether shock hits capacity, ore mined, or both.
shocks:
  capacity_stage_observed_kt_per_yr:
    shape: pulse
    start_year: 2028
    duration_years: 2
    multiplier: null
    targets:
      regions:
      - CHN
      materials:
      - Ni
      stages:
      - primary_extraction
notes:
- Use stabilizer in coupling to avoid oscillations when capacities bind.
